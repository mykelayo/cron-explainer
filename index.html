      <h2>Decode any cron expression into plain English instantly</h2>
      <p>

      </p>

      <h2>What is a cron expression?</h2>
      <p>
        A cron expression is a string of 5 space-separated fields used to define a recurring schedule
        for automated tasks. Cron jobs are commonly used in Linux systems, CI/CD pipelines, cloud
        functions, and server automation. The 5 fields are: minute (0-59), hour (0-23),
        day of month (1-31), month (1-12), and day of week (0-6, where Sunday is 0).
      </p>

      <h2>How to read cron expression fields</h2>
      <p>Each of the 5 cron fields supports special characters:</p>
      <p>Asterisk (*) — matches any value in the field (wildcard)</p>
      <p>Slash (/) — defines a step value. */15 means every 15 units.</p>
      <p>Hyphen (-) — defines a range. 1-5 means 1 through 5.</p>
      <p>Comma (,) — defines a list. 1,3,5 means 1, 3, and 5.</p>

      <h2>Common cron expression examples explained</h2>
      <p>* * * * * — runs every minute of every day</p>
      <p>0 * * * * — runs at minute 0 of every hour (every hour)</p>
      <p>0 0 * * * — runs at midnight every day</p>
      <p>0 9 * * 1-5 — runs at 9:00 AM Monday through Friday</p>
      <p>*/15 * * * * — runs every 15 minutes</p>
      <p>0 0 1 * * — runs at midnight on the first day of every month</p>
      <p>0 0 * * 0 — runs at midnight every Sunday</p>
      <p>30 18 * * 5 — runs at 6:30 PM every Friday</p>
      <p>0 */6 * * * — runs every 6 hours</p>
      <p>0 9,17 * * 1-5 — runs at 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM on weekdays</p>
